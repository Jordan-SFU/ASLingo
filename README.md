# ASLingo

We are building a website where people can learn the American Sign Language (ASL) basic gestures. The website will have a video of a person doing the gesture and a description of how to do the gesture. The website will also have a quiz section where the user can test their knowledge of the gestures. The website will be built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python.
